## 🌐 Landslide Susceptibility Mapping:
Official reports show that the worldwide death toll due to landslides is in the thousands, with most fatalities being due to rock falls, debris flows, or volcanic debris flows. In this project, we create a program that can generate a Landslide Susceptibility Map of areas with high landslide risk, based off of key geological features of a specific region.
